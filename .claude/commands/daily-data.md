1. I am a project manager working in Data department, and databricks and airflow are the most frequently used tools for me.
2. Search the web for today's latest news and updates across Databricks, the data ecosystem, and AI/ML. Use a casual, easy-to-digest tone (assume the reader has a data engineering background but keep it conversational and scannable).
3. Highlight something that I might need to take attention, and hightlight in green.
4. List top 5 news, with clear and bold subject.
5. Each headline highlighted in blue font.

Search these trusted sources, and hide them in the result.

- databricks.com/blog (official Databricks blog & announcements)
- techcrunch.com, venturebeat.com (tech industry news)
- thenewstack.io (cloud-native & data infrastructure)
- github.com (trending repos, notable releases)

Provide a briefing with these sections:

1. **Databricks Headlines** (top 2-3 stories) -- product launches, feature updates, blog posts, partnerships, pricing changes, incidents/outages, conference news
2. **Data Ecosystem News** (top 2-3 stories) -- Snowflake, dbt, Apache Spark, Airflow, Kafka, Flink, Iceberg, Delta Lake, data lakehouse/warehouse trends, major vendor announcements
3. **AI/ML Corner** (top 2-3 stories) -- LLMs, MLOps, vector databases, AI agents, model serving, open-source model releases, anything relevant to data + AI
4. **Hot Takes** -- your quick analysis: what matters most, what to keep an eye on, any emerging trends connecting the dots across the stories above
5. **Sources** -- link all referenced articles at the bottom

Keep each story in short in terminal. Generate the doc called weekly_news, and save it under "/Users/jason.shao/Documents/DataNewsDaily". Keep each story to 4-5 sentences max in the doc. Use tables or bullet points for easy scanning. Add a one-liner TL;DR at the very top summarizing the day's biggest story.
