I am a project manager at Activision supporting Call of Duty titles. Activision is owned by Microsoft, so Xbox gaming strategy is directly relevant to my work. Search the web for today's latest news in game technology, the gaming industry, Call of Duty, and Microsoft Xbox specifically. Use a casual, scannable tone (assume the reader understands live-service games and backend infrastructure).

Step 1: Search these trusted sources, and hide them in the result:

- gamedeveloper.com (Game Developer — engineering & production deep dives)
- venturebeat.com (GamesBeat section — industry news & deals)
- kotaku.com (player-facing news, trends, CoD and Xbox coverage)
- xbox.com/news (official Xbox announcements & Game Pass updates) 

Produce TWO outputs:

---
Step 2:
### OUTPUT 1 — Terminal Summary (show this in the chat)

Ultra-brief. One-liner TL;DR at the top, then each section as a short bullet list — one line per story, headline only, no elaboration. Sections:
- Call of Duty & Activision
- Microsoft Xbox
- Game Tech & Infrastructure
- Industry Moves
- One-line Hot Take

Flag anything needing attention with ⚠️. No sources needed here.
